# clickcounter
Full Stack web application created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Apache, and MySQL. This application is quite simple; it counts the number of times you've increment and decrement the counter. There is also the ability to reset the counter. Although it is a simple app, the implementation was *no where near simple*. Check out README for more details.
