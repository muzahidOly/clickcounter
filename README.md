# clickcounter
Full Stack web application created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Apache, and MySQL. This application is quite simple; it counts the number of times you've increment and decrement the counter. There is also the ability to reset the counter. Although it is a simple app, the implementation was *no where near simple*. 

1. I created the basic HTML body and added in some basic CSS to make it look presentable.
2. I had to connect to a local server in order to store my data, the amount of counts. I used Apache to connect to the server
3. I used PHP to connect the server to the database. In this case, I used mySQL as my database.
4. I printed the data, which was one simple row of data; it contained the amount of clicks only.
5. I created 3 buttons, a increment, a decrement, and a reset count button.
6. I linked each button to their following php file
7. Each php file either added 1 to the counter, removed 1, or reset the count to 0


The reason behind creating this basic application is simply so i can have some hands on experience in Full Stack web development.I made numerous amounts of mistake. I'm 300% sure there were much much easier ways to do this, but i felt like I needed to first understand the brute force method before i can move on to tricks and shortcuts.  This project was absurdy complex, but I had fun and enjoyed my time creating this application. Thanks for reading!
